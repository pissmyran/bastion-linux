# Releases

## Versions

Bastion for Linux has its own versions, independent of the other platforms. A version is a SemVer tag `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with a GitHub Release. The platform's own version fields, for example an app store build number, are something else.

## The PR title sets the version

The PR title becomes the commit on `main` and follows Conventional Commits. The release computes the version from the titles since the previous release:

| Title | Gives |
| --- | --- |
| `!` after the type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | major |
| `feat:` | minor |
| `fix:`, `perf:`, `revert:` | patch |
| `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:` | no release |

## The flow

1. A PR is merged to `main`.
2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` computes the version from the commits since the latest tag, or since the commit in `.github/release-baseline` if there is no tag yet.
3. The release waits until the checks in `.github/release-required-checks` are green on the same commit.
4. The tag and the GitHub Release are created.
5. The documentation is built from the tag and published on [GitHub Pages](https://pissmyran.github.io/bastion_linux/).

A merge that only contains, for example, `docs:` releases no new version, so the documentation is published at the next release.

## Required checks

`.github/release-required-checks` holds one check per line. Today it is the CodeQL analysis for the platform's language (`Analyze (rust)`). When a build and test workflow exists, its check should be added there.

## A release is not distribution

A GitHub Release publishes nothing to an app store or package manager. Distribution is a separate step.

## Fixing a bad release

Tags are never moved. Fix it with a regular PR (`fix:` or `revert:`) instead, and the next release creates a new version.
